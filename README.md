# IEEE Special Issue Tracker

**Website: https://klb2.github.io/ieee-special-issue-tracker/**

This repository provides a simple website that lists open call for papers for
special issues of various IEEE journals.
It is automatically updated every Sunday.

Note that this list is not complete and only features certain IEEE societies.
Please report any issues/bugs that you find as a GitHub issue.

request.

## Usage/Development
If you want to build the website on your own, you need to have Python3
installed on your machine.

To install all required packages simply run
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The website is generated by running
```bash
python3 generate_website.py
```

The final website can then be found as `public/index.html`.
